# Geckium
## A love letter to the history of Chromium and its derivatives

##### Geckium is not officially developed, approved or endorsed by Google!

(todo: image here of all themes/etc.)

Geckium is a Mozilla Firefox **(115 - latest)** CSS and JS modification that restores the look and feel of past Chromium (or Google Chrome) releases, spanning from 1.0 to 68, while also bringing Chromium Theme support to Firefox, bringing obscure prerelease content to the limelight and retrofitting new content into every design.

## Coming from Silverfox?

Just install Geckium normally by deleting your `chrome` folder and placing Geckium's `chrome` folder in its place - upon launching Geckium it will automatically migrate the settings you had from Silverfox to Geckium's settings.

# Compatibility

Geckium is designed for the following platforms:

- Linux (tested on Arch, by the way, Fedora KDE, Fedora, Kubuntu and Feren OS)
- Windows 7
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10 (with Native Controls Patch)
- Windows 11
- macOS* (tested on Sonoma)

*Mac OS X's 3-6 eras may be inaccurate as we were unsuccessful in finding DMGs of those versions

However,

- Geckium **CANNOT** work properly with WindowBlinds
- Compatibility with Firefox forks is never guaranteed - minor adjustments will be made by Geckium to accommodate itself in Firefox forks, but issues not seen in Firefox may still occur.
- Due to the nature of how their packages are created, Geckium CANNOT be used in Mozilla Firefox from Flathub nor Ubuntu (and Snap Store). Ubuntu users will have to install Firefox from the Mozilla PPA in order to use Geckium. 

# Instructions

TBD, because bad GitHub coding.
